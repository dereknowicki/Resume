Designed and conducted experiments with Roomba Robots related to how changes in temperature effect the Simultaneous Location And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm for robot navigation. Wrote detailed research documents on experiments using the IMRAD scientific document organizational structure with LyX Document Processor software. The research documents that I wrote provided charts illustrating data which were created with Python using Matplotlib, a Matlab-like plotting library. I also wrote hardware testing automation scripts in Python to be used on in-house, custom-built, product testing hardware; as well as detailed tutorials for manual testing and calibration for both production and testing hardware.
